This project
involved creating a website for the surgeon to manage patient
data, specifically for patients with pulmonary metastasis. The
website allowed the surgeon to upload and share patient
information with radiotherapists securely. Key features
included patient profiles with fields for first name, last name,
primary tumor, number of metastasis, and CT images. The site
also provided a private login system, with admin and user
access, allowing the surgeon to modify content. Implemented
statistics included a pie chart depicting the 'Primary tumor'
category. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Python,
Django, and SQL
